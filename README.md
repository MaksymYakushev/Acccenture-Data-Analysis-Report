## Task 1:  Project Understanding

First task is to read the brief from Social Buzz. [Read the brief](https://github.com/MaksymYakushev/Acccenture-Data-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Task1/Data_Analytics%20Client%20Brief.pdf) to:
- Understand the client and business problem at hand.
- Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
- Identify which tasks you should focus on as a Data Analyst.

So, we are start our engagement with Social Buzz, we are running a 3 month initial project in order
to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following:
- An audit of their big data practice
- Recommendations for a successful IPO
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the
largest aggregate popularity

Tasks to be delegated:
- Creation of an up-to-date big data best practices presentation
- Extraction of sample data sets using SQL
- On-site audit of their data-center
- Merging of sample data set tables
- Virtual session with Social Buzz team to present previous client success stories relevant
to them
- Preparation of best practice document for IPO
- Loading of sample data sets into Accenture sandbox database
- Technology architecture workshop with Social Buzz Data Team to understand their
technology landscape
- Stress testing of their technology to identify weak spots
- Communication with previous IPO companies within our client base for reference stories
- Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations
- Full documentation of the process that we can guide them through for IPO

**Completed a short knowledge check:**

**Question 1 of 2**

Which statement best describes the business problem that Accenture is tasked to address for this project?   
**Answer:** The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it.

**Question 2 of 2**

Which statement lists the three requirements that Accenture is tasked to fulfill for this project?  
**Answer:** Audit of big data practice, recommendations for IPO, analysis of popular content.

**Meet your Accenture team**   

[My team](https://github.com/MaksymYakushev/Acccenture-Data-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Task1/Internal%20stakeholder%20chart.pdf)   

The team is structured in three key groups:

- **Industry experts** in the social media space to ensure we accurately understand Social Buzz’s sector.   
- **IPO experts** who will deliver on the IPO requirement.   
- **Data experts** who will provide Big Data insights and content category analysis.   

**Completed a short knowledge check:**  

**Question 1 of 1**
Which task out of these options is the most relevant to you as a data analyst, and therefore which one will you work on?  
**Answer:** Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories   

## Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling

**Let's dive into the data**

So, let’s have a look at what data have to work with. The client has sent through:

- **7 data sets** - each data set contains different columns and values.   
- **A data model** - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.  

**Requirements gathering**

First step is to use this data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer our business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

[Data Model](https://github.com/MaksymYakushev/Acccenture-Data-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Task2/Data%20model.pdf)

Definitions of different data types:
- **String** - Sequence of characters, digits, or symbols—always treated as text
- **UUID** - Universally Unique Identifiers
- **Array** - List with a number of elements in a specific order—typically of the same type
- **Integer** - Numeric data type for numbers without fractions
- **Timestamp** - Number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight (00:00:00 UTC), 1st January 1970 (Unix time)

**Completed a short knowledge check:**  

**Question 1 of 1**  Which three data sets will you need to complete your analysis?   
**Answer:** Reaction, Content, Reaction Types.  

**Data sets**  

To clarify why we made this selection:  
- The brief carefully it states that the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.
- As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type.
- We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
- So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.

**Data Cleaning**  

Data cleaning is a common and very important task when working with data.

**First:** Open the three data sets below

[Reactions](https://github.com/MaksymYakushev/Acccenture-Data-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Task2/Reactions.csv)
[Content](https://github.com/MaksymYakushev/Acccenture-Data-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Task2/Content.csv)
[Reaction types](https://github.com/MaksymYakushev/Acccenture-Data-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Task2/ReactionTypes.csv)  

**Second:** Clean the data by:   
- removing rows that have values which are missing,
- changing the data type of some values within a column, and
- removing columns which are not relevant to this task.

As a result should be three cleaned data sets. 

**Data Modelling**

**1. Create a final data set by merging your three tables together**  

We can use a “VLookUp” formula for merging three tables together. So I did it.

**2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories**  

Using pivot tables, I got sums for each of the categories. I sorted by decreasing score and got top 5 performing categories.  

| Category | Score SUM |   
| -------- | -------- |  
| Animals | 74965 |
| Science | 71168 |
| Healthy eating | 69339 |
| Technology | 68738 |
| Food | 66676 | 

[The end result](https://github.com/MaksymYakushev/Acccenture-Data-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Task2/CleanedDataset_TheTopFiveCategories.xlsx) it's one spreadsheet which contains: a cleaned dataset and the top 5 categories.

## Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling

**Build your presentation Structure**  
Here is a [template](https://github.com/MaksymYakushev/Acccenture-Data-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Task3/Data%20Analytics%20template%20-%20Task%203_final.pptx) that Accenture use to create a presentation.   

**Completed a short knowledge check:**  

**Question 1 of 1**  Have you completed slides 2-6 in your presentation?  
**Answer:** Yes!  

**Quick explanation**




**Create my charts**

The final step of this task is to populate slides 7 - 10 with my data insights.

We know that the client wants to understand the top 5 content categories. Have a think about what are the best ways to present this? In a pie chart? In a bar chart?  

There are also some other interesting insights that we might want to share with them. For example:   
- How many unique categories are there?
- How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
- What was the month with the most posts?   

**1. Insights**  

<img src="https://github.com/MaksymYakushev/Acccenture-Data-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Task3/Insights.jpg" width="620" height="340">

There are a total of 16 unique categories. 

With the help of pivot tables, the largest number of reactions to categories was determined. Сhose the largest one, that is "Animal". I got 1897 Reactions to content with animals. 

Also got the month with the most posts. To do this, I added a new column called "Month" to the [Cleaned Dataset](https://github.com/MaksymYakushev/Acccenture-Data-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Task3/CleanedDataset_TheTopFiveCategories_forPresentation.xlsx) and determined in which month the post was made using the MONTH() formula. Then, using pivot tables, I determined the month with the largest number of posts. It was May.   

| Month | COUNT Month |   
| -------- | -------- |  
| 1 | 2126 |
| 2 | 1914 |
| 3 | 2012 |
| 4 | 1974 |
| 5 | 2138 |   
| 6 | 2021 |
| 7 | 2070 |
| 8 | 2114 |
| 9 | 2022 |
| 10 | 2056 |  
| 11 | 2034 |
| 12 | 2092 |
